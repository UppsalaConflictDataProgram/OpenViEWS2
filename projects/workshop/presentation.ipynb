    "\n",
    "### Before we start\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hello! I'm Frederick.\n",
    "* Audio / Video OK?\n",
    "* Please ask questions as we go.\n",

    "#### The original\n",
    "First there was \n",
    "* the original ViEWS github repository. ( https://github.com/UppsalaConflictDataProgram/views/ )\n",
    "* With an old public mirror at https://github.com/UppsalaConflictDataProgram/openviews\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros/cons?\n",
    "\n",
    "* (+) Still working to churn out monthly forecasts.\n",
    "* (-) There was no package structure to this repository, no `import views`.\n",
    "* (-) Model specification a janky mess of scripts that generated paramfiles using black magic.\n",
    "* (-) Very difficult to maintain and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The gitlab\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first paper publication I (frehoy) decided to create a new repository to try and structure the code and make it easier to work with while retaining the original repository for monthly forecasta production.\n",
    "It exists at https://gitlab.com/frehoy/views and is currently private, ask for an invite if you want one.\n",
    "That repository is now where all ViEWS functionality that went into the JPR 2020 paper resides.\n",
    "Just before JPR 2020 publication it will be pushed as a separate branch to https://github.com/UppsalaConflictDataProgram/openviews2\n",
    "\n",
    "* (+) Has a package that you can `import views` from\n",
    "* (+) Has a lot of cool functionality\n",
    "* (-) Relies heavily on naming conventions and passing dictionaries around.\n",
    "* (-) Has a lot of half-fininshed, in-a-hurry functionality\n",
    "* (-) Doesn't include some core database functionality\n",
    "* (-) Isn't on github under the UCDP organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This one (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This new repository, with\n",
    "* a private version here:  https://github.com/UppsalaConflictDataProgram/views2/\n",
    "* and a public copy here: https://github.com/UppsalaConflictDataProgram/openviews2\n",
    "\n",
    "aims to fix the negatives of the gitlab repository and bring balance to the force.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📦 Has a package that you can `import views` from.\n",
    "* 🧠 Has a clear way to go from model/ensemble development to production.\n",
    "* 👮‍♂️ Has a stricter layout.\n",
    "* 📕 Has a manual!\n",
    "* ✅ Has tests.\n",
    "* 👩‍🎨 Has a code formatter.\n",
    "* ⚠️ Has type checking.\n",
    "* 😡 Doesn't yet have all the functionality from the gitlab repository.\n",
    "* 🏗 Is a work in progress."
